Usage: php sss.php [-q | -v] [-c config] [-i <logfile or directory>] [-o html]
       php sss.php [-q | -v] [-c config] [-e target]
       php sss.php [-q | -v] [-c config] [-m source]

Options:
        -c <file>
                Read settings from <file>. By default "sss.conf" is read.

        -e <file>
                Export all user relations in the database to <file>.

        -i <file|directory>
                Parse a single logfile <file> or all logfiles in <directory>.
                Gzipped logfiles with the ".gz" extension will be processed by
                the parser. After the last logfile has been parsed, database
                maintenance will commence to ensure a usable dataset.

        -m <file>
                Import user relations from <file> into the database. Existing
                relations will be unset prior to any updates made. It is highly
                recommended to keep an export as backup. Nicks contained in
                <file> are treated as case insensitive and nicks which don't
                exist in the database will be ignored.

        -o <file>
                Generate statistics and output to <file>.

        -q
                Quiet mode. Output only errors.

        -v
                Verbose mode. Useful to see parser issues if any.

Examples:
        Parse all logfiles found in "~/irclogs/foobar/" and create a stats
        page named "/var/www/foobar.html":

                $ php sss.php -i ~/irclogs/foobar/ -o /var/www/foobar.html
